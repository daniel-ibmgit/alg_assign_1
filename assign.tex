\section*{Problem 1 - Question a}
We are solving Problem 1, and the question is to analyze the function \(10n^4 + 7n^2 + 3n\).

\section*{Proof By Definition:}
By definition, a function \(t(n)\) is said to be in \(\Theta(g(n))\) if \(t(n)\) is bounded both above and below by some positive constant multiples of \(g(n)\) for all large \(n\), i.e.,
\[ c_2 g(n) \leq t(n) \leq c_1 g(n) \]
for all \(n \geq n_{\text{o}}\).

\section*{Proof by Limit:}
When computing the limit of two functions in question, three principal cases may arise:
\[
\lim_{{n \to \infty}} \frac{t(n)}{g(n)} =
\begin{cases}
0 & : \text{implies that } t(n) \text{ has a smaller order of growth than } g(n) \\
c & : \text{implies that } t(n) \text{ has the same order of growth as } g(n) \\
\infty & : \text{implies that } t(n) \text{ has a larger order of growth than } g(n)
\end{cases}
\]

\subsection*{Proof for \(t(n) = 10n^4 + 7n^2 + 3n\) and \(g(n) = n^4\)}

\textbf{Proof by Definition:}

\[ c_2n^4 \leq 10n^4 + 7n^2 + 3n \leq c_1n^4 \]

Let's first prove the right inequality:

\[ \frac{10n^4 + 7n^2 + 3n}{n^4} \leq \frac{c_1n^4}{n^4} \]

\[ 10 + 7\left(\frac{n^2}{n^4}\right) + 3\left(\frac{n}{n^4}\right) = c_1 \]

\[ 10 + \frac{7}{n^2} + \frac{3}{n^3} \leq c_1 \]

Choose \(n = n_0 = c_1\):

\[ 10 + \frac{7}{1^2} + \frac{3}{1^3} \leq c_1 \]

\[ 20 \leq c_1 \]

\(c_1 \geq 20\), so \(c_1 = 20\)

Now, let's prove the left inequality.
